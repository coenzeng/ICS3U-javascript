		/*The following is an example of a counter. Each time the loop loops, it adds 1 to the existing value of the counter, and then sets it to the variable counter. If we were to not increase the value of counter, the while loop would always be less than 10, therefore, would never finish. When the condition of a while loop always remains TRUE, it is sometimes referred to as AN INFINITE LOOP (infinite recursion). */
