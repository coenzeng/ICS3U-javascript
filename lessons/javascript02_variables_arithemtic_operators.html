	/*
	There are four basic rules for naming variables:
	1) use descriptive names without any spaces
	2) you can not start a variable with a number
	3) you can not start a variable with a keyword
	4) you can not start a variable with an operator
	
	There are four basic types of variables:
	1) integer (int): any positive or negative WHOLE numebr
	2) floating point number (float): any positive or negative number with a decimal
	3) boolean:a variable that can only be TRUE or FALSE
	4) string: any 'sting' of characters, numbers, letters, or spaces

	var intNumber = 2;
	var floNumber = 2.3;
	var strVariable = "twenty three";
	var yesno = true;
	
	/* 
	
	We have 5 basic arithmetic operators:
	+ addition
	- subtraction
	* multiplication
	/ division
	% mod/module/modulous --> calculates the remainder of the division

	var x = 20;
	var y = 3;
	
	alert(x + y); //answer:23
	alert(x - y); //answer:17
	alert(x * y); //answer:60
	alert(x / y); //answer: 6.66666
	alert(x % y); //answer:2 because 3 goes into 20 6 times (18), remainder 2
	
	//Let's use variables and arithmetic operators together
	var apples = 7;
	var pears = 3;
	var totalFruit = apples + pears;
	
	//Remember to follow BEDMAS / order of operations
	var totalFruit = apples + pears *10
	alert(totalFruit) //answer: 37
	
	var first = "20"
	var second = "19";
	alert(first + second); //answer: 2019
	/* When we add strings together, it joins them. This is called CONCATENATION */
	
	var name = "Bob";
	var last  = "Smith";
	alert(name + last); //answer BobSmith
	alert("Hi! My name is " + name + " " + last "!Please to meet you.")
	//answer: Hi! My name is Bob smith! Pleased to meet you.
